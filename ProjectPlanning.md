# Project Plan

For this project my idea initiallty is to write a simple chat with a side panel for display an iframe with a DocuSeal document embedded in it.

The project consists a in an AI agent to help users to fill a DocuSeal document according to some specifications.

The project will be developed in React using TS and Tailwind for styling. This part I already made.

### Project Structure

1. A backend service to hold the DocuSeal integration and the user data that will be used to fill the DocuSeal document.
2. A Frontend Chat component to hold communication with the user.
3. A Side panel to display the DocuSeal document.
4. A frontend interface with an AI that will receive user data from backend and send it formatted to AI service along with user filled data in the chat.

### Backend

To deploy an API along with the running service that will be opaque and serve as the backend for the project, you can use a service like Vercel or Netlify. These platforms allow you to deploy both frontend and backend services seamlessly.

We will use some features from Vercel to deploy the backend service. The API calls will be used to communicate with DocuSeal API, The AI Api and the user data.

We will use the /api folder inside the project for that. We also need a way to be able to test it.

### Frontend

The frontend will be a simple React application that will hold the chat component and the side panel.

#### Chat Component

-Chat will show AI messages in one side and user messages in the other.
-User messages will be sent to the backend and the AI messages will be shown in the chat.
-The chat will have a button to send the message to the backend and another one to clear the chat.
-When the responses sent by the AI contains <button> tags, the chat will replace the <button> tag with a button component that user would be able to click and send the response imediatelly to the AI.

- When AI reesponds with a structure JSON object we need to be able to grab this JSON and send it to DocuSeal to fill the PDF form document.

#### Side Panel

The side panel will display the DocuSeal document. We will use the response from DocuSeal API todisplay an iFrame with the document.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup and Local Development Environment

### 2. Backend API Implementation (/api)

3. DocuSeal Integration:

   - Implement DocuSeal API client
   - Create middleware for API authentication
   - Build endpoints for document operations
   - Test document creation and updates

4. AI Integration:
   - Set up AI service client
   - Create message handling middleware
   - Implement prompt engineering
   - Build response parsing utilities

### 3. Frontend Implementation

1. Chat Component:

   - Create base chat container
   - Implement message bubbles
   - Add message input with send button
   - Build message history management
   - Create custom hooks:
     ```typescript
     useChat(); // Chat state management
     useAIMessage(); // AI message handling
     useDocuSeal(); // DocuSeal operations
     ```

2. Message Parsing:

   - Create parser for button tags
   - Implement JSON response handler
   - Build DocuSeal form filler
   - Add error handling

3. Side Panel:
   - Create resizable panel component
   - Implement iframe container
   - Add DocuSeal document viewer
   - Build document state management

### 4. Integration and State Management

1. Create central state management:

   - Chat history
   - Document state
   - User data
   - Form completion status

2. Build API integration layer:
   - Create API client
   - Implement error handling
   - Add retry logic
   - Build request/response interceptors

### 5. Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests:

   - API endpoints
   - Message parsing
   - Button generation
   - Form filling logic

2. Integration Tests:

   - Chat flow
   - Document updates
   - API communication
   - State management

3. E2E Tests:
   - Complete user flows
   - Document filling
   - Error scenarios

### 6. Local Development Workflow

1. API Testing:

   ```bash
   # Start local development
   vercel dev

   # Test specific API endpoint
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/chat/send-message
   ```

2. Environment Setup:

   ```env
   # .env.local
   DOCUSEAL_API_KEY=your_key
   AI_API_KEY=your_key
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Development Commands:

   ```bash
   # Run development server
   npm run dev

   # Run tests
   npm test

   # Run API tests
   npm run test:api
   ```

### 7. Deployment Pipeline

1. Vercel Setup:

   - Configure project in Vercel
   - Set up environment variables
   - Configure build settings
   - Set up preview deployments

2. CI/CD:
   - Add GitHub Actions
   - Configure test automation
   - Set up deployment triggers
   - Add monitoring

### 8. Documentation

1. API Documentation:

   - Endpoint specifications
   - Request/response formats
   - Error codes
   - Usage examples

2. Component Documentation:
   - Props documentation
   - Usage guidelines
   - State management
   - Event handling

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the project. Each step should be implemented incrementally, with testing at each stage. The local development setup using Vercel CLI ensures that API endpoints can be tested thoroughly before deployment.

Remember to:

- Start with basic implementations and iterate
- Test each component in isolation
- Document as you build
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider security implications at each step
